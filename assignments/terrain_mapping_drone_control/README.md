# Assignment 3: Rocky Times Challenge - Search, Map, & Analyze

This ROS2 package implements an autonomous drone system for geological feature detection, mapping, and analysis using an RGBD camera and PX4 SITL simulation.

## Challenge 
To develop a controller for a PX4-powered drone to efficiently search, map, and analyze cylindrical rock formations in an unknown environment. The drone will identify two rock formations (10m and 7m tall cylinders), estimate their dimensions, and successfully land on top of the taller cylinder.

### Mission Objectives
1. Search and locate all cylindrical rock formations
2. Map and analyze rock dimensions:
   - Estimate height and diameter of each cylinder
   - Determine positions in the world frame
3. Land safely on top of the taller cylinder
4. Complete mission while logging time and energy performance.

Comparison of Search Strategies

## üîç Comparison of Search Strategies

| Strategy                         | Description                                                                                                                                     | Use Case                                                                                     | This Project |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1. Lawnmower (Systematic Sweep)  | Drone flies in parallel lines (like mowing a lawn), covering the area uniformly. Line spacing depends on the RGBD camera's field of view (FOV). | Best for exhaustive coverage of a known-size environment.                                    | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| 2. Spiral Search                 | Starts from the center and expands outward in a spiral pattern, increasing radius incrementally.                                                | Ideal when the target is expected near the center or when the area is circular.              | ‚ùå Not Used   |
| 3. Random Search                 | Drone selects random directions, relying on chance-based coverage and sensor feedback to find targets.                                         | Useful in highly uncertain or unmapped environments, though potentially inefficient.         | ‚ùå Not Used   |
| 4. Frontier-Based Exploration    | Identifies frontiers (boundaries between explored and unexplored regions) and prioritizes them using RGBD camera and real-time mapping.        | Optimal in unknown environments using SLAM (e.g., RTAB-Map) to maximize exploration utility. | ‚ùå Not Used   |
| 5. Grid-Based Search with Optimization | Area is divided into discrete grid cells; drone follows an optimized path (e.g., A*, TSP) to maximize efficiency.                        | Best when combining systematic coverage with path planning in semi-known or cluttered areas. | ‚ùå Not Used   |

üìå This project uses a Lawnmower (Systematic Sweep) strategy to perform area coverage. If an ArUco marker is detected during the sweep, the drone aborts the survey and transitions into a precision approach and landing mode.

## Methodology

### 1. Selecting Optimal Search Stratergy:
We will compare outputs from two strategies: Spiral Search and Lawnmower (Bourstrophedon pattern) Search

**Optimal/Safe Choice:** **_Lawnmower Search_**

1. Guaranteed Coverage: Ensures detection of both 10m and 7m cylinders by calculating passes based on camera FOV within known bounds.
2. Safety and Precision: Straight-line paths reduce instability, aiding safe and precise landing on the 10m cylinder with PX4 control.

---

### Safe and precise landing on the target cylinder (My Accoplishment)

### üß† Mission Workflow

1. Drone takes off to a predefined altitude (e.g., 12 meters).
2. Executes a boustrophedon coverage of a specified 2D area.
3. During the survey, the downward-facing camera monitors for ArUco markers.
4. Upon detecting a marker:
   - The drone aborts the remainder of the survey.
   - Calculates the marker‚Äôs global position using solvePnP and onboard odometry.
   - Gradually approaches the marker location using position setpoints.
   - Hovers and stabilizes over the marker.
   - Initiates a smooth vertical descent and lands directly over the target.

### üì¶ Project Structure

All logic is encapsulated in a single ROS 2 Python node:

| Component              | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ArUco Detection         | OpenCV-based detection from `/drone/down_mono` camera stream                |
| Marker Pose Estimation | Uses solvePnP + camera intrinsics + PX4 odometry for global position inference |
| State Machine           | TAKEOFF ‚Üí SURVEY ‚Üí GOTO_ARUCO ‚Üí HOVER ‚Üí DESCEND ‚Üí LAND                     |
| PX4 Control             | Publishes to `/fmu/in/trajectory_setpoint`, `/fmu/in/vehicle_command`, etc. |

---

### ‚úàÔ∏è ROS 2 Topics Used

- `/drone/down_mono` ‚Äî input camera feed (mono8)
- `/drone/down_mono/camera_info` ‚Äî camera intrinsics for solvePnP
- `/fmu/out/vehicle_odometry` ‚Äî PX4 odometry data
- `/fmu/in/offboard_control_mode` ‚Äî offboard position control
- `/fmu/in/trajectory_setpoint` ‚Äî position setpoints
- `/fmu/in/vehicle_command` ‚Äî arming, landing, and mode commands

---

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. Ensure ROS 2 Humble, PX4 SITL, and MAVROS interface are properly set up.
2. Calibrate the camera and ensure intrinsics are published to `/drone/down_mono/camera_info`.
3. Clone this repository and build:
   ```bash
   colcon build --packages-select terrain_mapping_drone_control
   source install/setup.bash
   ```
4. Run the mission node:
   ```bash
   ros2 run terrain_mapping_drone cylinder_landing.launch.py
   ./QGroundControl.AppImage
   ./aruco_lawnmower_landing.py
   ```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters

- ArUco marker size: 0.8 meters
- Camera assumed to be mounted facing downward
- Takeoff height: 15.0 meters (adjustable)
- Landing height: 0.2 meters (hover-close to ground)
- Survey resolution: 2.0 m steps (modifiable)

---

### üìå Notes

- ArUco detection uses OpenCV 4.7+ (compatible with cv2.aruco.ArucoDetector).
- Marker detection starts only after successful takeoff.
- Boustrophedon survey is immediately aborted if an ArUco marker is detected.
- The drone hovers for a short period over the marker before initiating descent.

---
### ü§ù RESULTS

During testing in Gazebo simulation, the drone successfully:

- Performed a complete takeoff and transition into a boustrophedon coverage pattern.
- Detected the ArUco marker in real-time using the downward camera stream.
- Computed the marker's approximate global position using solvePnP and PX4 odometry.
- Aborted the remaining survey path upon detection and redirected toward the marker.
- Hovered above the estimated marker location for stabilization.
- Performed a gradual descent and executed a controlled landing sequence.

üìå However, in repeated trials, the drone consistently landed slightly off-center ‚Äî adjacent to the ArUco marker (e.g. next to the cylinder) instead of directly above it.

This offset is likely due to:

- Frame misalignment or transform errors between camera and body frames.
- Inaccurate offset mapping of solvePnP tvec into world frame.
- Inconsistent detection depth (Z) or noisy odometry during descent.



## üéØ Experimental Trials Overview

Below are the recorded results from three autonomous drone missions using the ArUco-guided Boustrophedon landing system. Each trial includes full execution of the lawnmower survey, ArUco marker detection, hover stabilization, and landing maneuver.

üìå Observation:  
In all trials, the complete mission pipeline functioned as expected ‚Äî including survey, marker detection, hover stabilization, and descent. However, the drone consistently landed slightly beside the ArUco marker rather than directly on top of it. This minor offset may stem from coordinate frame mismatch, noisy tvec estimation, or accumulated drift.
